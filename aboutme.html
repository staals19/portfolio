<p title="questions">Based on what you've learned so far, what are some similarities between Python and Scratch? What are some differences?: Python and Scratch are similar because they both use the same basic concepts.
The Core Four (loops, variables, functions, and conditions) are used in both programs. They mainly differ in syntax, and because Scratch is drag-and-drop and Python is typing.
</p>

<p>Today, you likely had to spend time debugging your program. How did that feel? What did you like about it? What was hard?: Debugging was satisfying because it gave me a chance to solve a problem. However, at times
it could be frustrating. Reading the errors could be difficult, especially if you were getting an error on a line of code that you thought was correct.
</p>

<p>Today, you learned about data structures. Describe what a list is and how it is useful in your own words: A list is something that can hold several different pieces of data that are all grouped together. This can
  be useful when you are trying to work with the same set of data repeatedly, because you can call upon specific sections of a list.
</p>

<p>You worked with a few different partners and in a few different groups today. Which group worked best together? Why?: I wasn't here yesterday so I didn't really work with anyone. But Carolina gave me a simple solution to a
  problem I was having trouble with. It's really helpful to get input from people who have already finished the project.
</p>

<p>I thought to Obamicon project was really cool. It was hard to figure out the intensity aspect. From the core four, you needed variables to be a placeholder for individual pixels. If I had unlimited ability,
  I'd like to make filters that could put you in different places and have it look realistic. My favorite part of today was python, I really liked working on the number sorter.
</p>

<p> Circuits are difficult! I learned about how circuits are structured for different uses. It was challenging to make everything exact so it worked. </p>

<p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both do work with AI and attempt to make robotics a large part of the future. We worked together by trying to figure out how code and the circuits worked together.
  I'm not sure how other groups handled this. The basic Arduino sketch needs the battery, jumper cables, and a light. </p>

<p> I learned that circuits can be/are used for most electrical things to work. I liked working with the robot's movement and the piezo. Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard needed movement, sound, and motion sensors for their
  robots. </p>

<p> LaTex sounds like a markup language, since it focuses on formatting. I thought that people's drop-down menus and scrolling were really cool and looked really good. A JavaScript challenge I faced was trying to get my
  JS functions to work in the HTML coding. </p>
