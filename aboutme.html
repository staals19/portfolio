<p title="questions">Based on what you've learned so far, what are some similarities between Python and Scratch? What are some differences?: Python and Scratch are similar because they both use the same basic concepts.
<br>
The Core Four (loops, variables, functions, and conditions) are used in both programs. They mainly differ in syntax, and because Scratch is drag-and-drop and Python is typing.
</p>

<p>Today, you likely had to spend time debugging your program. How did that feel? What did you like about it? What was hard?: Debugging was satisfying because it gave me a chance to solve a problem. However, at times
it could be frustrating. Reading the errors could be difficult, especially if you were getting an error on a line of code that you thought was correct.
